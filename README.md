# Recallio - Your Digital Memory Assistant

Recallio is an innovative application designed to help you save, organize, and recall your digital memories at the perfect moment. Whether it's a YouTube video, a social media reel, or any other type of digital content, Recallio enables you to store these items with descriptions and set reminders to bring them back to your attention when needed.

## Features

- **Save Digital Memories**: Capture and store links to digital content, such as YouTube videos, social media reels, articles, and more, along with custom descriptions.
- **Set Reminders**: Receive notifications at a specific time to remind you of the content you've saved.
- **Search & Recall**: Easily search through your stored memories and retrieve them when you need to revisit them.
- **Organize by Categories**: Group and tag your memories for easier access and organization.

## How It Works

1. **Save a Memory**: You can save any digital content by sharing it directly to Recallio, or you can manually add the link and provide a keyword or brief description of why it's important or interesting.
2. **Set a Reminder**: If you want to be reminded by Recallio, simply tap "Remind Me," and choose a time and date to be notified about your saved memory.
3. **Search & Recall**: Use the search functionality to find specific memories and view them again when needed.

## Why Recallio?

In today's fast-paced digital world, itâ€™s easy to come across interesting or important content, but we often forget about it when we need it. Recallio serves as your personal digital assistant to help you remember and engage with the content you find valuable.
